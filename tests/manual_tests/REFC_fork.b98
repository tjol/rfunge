 This test illustrates one (deliberate) incompatibility
 between rfunge and the original docs for REFC: in rfunge,
 the reference list of vectors is not global. Rather, it
 is considered an inherited property of the IP that is
 shared between IPs (as long as they are created after
 loading / first using the fingerprint).
