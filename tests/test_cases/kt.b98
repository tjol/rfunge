Inspired by a cfunge test: what happens when you repeat t?
cfunge, pyfunge and rfunge show the arguably correct behaviour, printing
    pccccccccccr
rcfunge appears to send some of the child IPs in the wrong direction?
    ppppppcccccr
CCBI appears to split twice at the t (should be at the k?) and ends up
with 4 IPs
    pprr
rfunge previously (erroneously) split twice, once at the t and once at the k:
    pcr
